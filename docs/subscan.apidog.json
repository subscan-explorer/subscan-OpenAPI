                    "content": "With Subscan API, we provide a simple way to access the chain data of more than 90 substrate-based networks.\n\nIf you have any question or suggestion, please do not hesitate to contact our API support via [api@subscan.io](mailto:api@subscan.io).\n\nThe documentation was created with [apidog](apidog.com).\n\n## API Keys\n\n**Get a free API key that includes higher quotas or start your trial with other available plans\nat <https://pro.subscan.io/>.**\n\n## Service Status\n\nThe service status of Subscan API can be found on our [status page](https://subscan.statuspage.io).\n\n## Service Level Agreement\n\nSubscan provides our customers the Service Level Agreement (SLA), which includes **Monthly Uptime Percentage**\ncommitment for multiple networks. Please contact us ([api@subscan.io](mailto:api@subscan.io)) for more information.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\nPlease notice before you get started:\n\n1. The following endpoints list is maintained manually and it might be outdated. In fact, every individual network\n   supported on Subscan.io will have available API endpoint as well. The endpoint naming convention\n   is `https://$NETWORK_NAME.api.subscan.io` where the `$NETWORK_NAME` is the same as the subdomain of the corresponding\n   network on Subscan.io.\n\n2. All the endpoints are forced to HTTPS only. Please make sure you use `https://` with the API hosts.\n\n3. SLA covered endpoints are shown on our [service status page](https://subscan.statuspage.io/). Several networks are\n   excluded from our SLA for now. It might because: 1) the network is a testnet, not as stable as a mainnet, or could be\n   reset in a relatively higher chance; 2) the chain RPC that Subscan relied on is maintained by others (e.g. the chain\n   developers). We may update the covered list in the future. Please let us know if you want to have other networks\n   included in the SLA.\n\n4. The **Status** marked as **live** is production network, and it will be maintained continuously. The **Status**\n   marked as **test** is test network, which may be unstable. Some new features of Subscan will be updated on testnet\n   first.\n\n5. All APIs documented here are specifically designed for Subscan UI. While they may undergo frequent updates,\n   we strictly avoid introducing breaking changes. In the rare event of a mandatory breaking change, we will issue\n    advance email notifications to all subscribers.\n\n| Network              | API Host                                       | Status

The quotas of no-key access are relatively lower and designed for testing purposes only.\n\n</aside>\n\nCurrently, the quotas are global - shared across all APIs, all networks, and all client IP addresses as well. For instance, if an API key has a quota of *10* requests per second:\n\n- Client *A* requests `https://polkadot.api.subscan.io/api/now` with an API key;\n- Simultaneously, client *B* requests `https://kusama.api.subscan.io/api/scan/metadata` with the same API key.\n- After these *2* requests, only *8* requests with the same API key are allowed in that second.\n\nSubscan API respects the Internet-Draft [RateLimit Header Fields for HTTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-01). Through the headers of any response, it is simple to retrieve the limit (`ratelimit-limit`), remaining quota (`ratelimit-remaining`), and the seconds until the limit resets (`ratelimit-reset`) of your key. For example, send any request:\n\n<div class=\"center-column\"></div>\n\n```shell\ncurl -isS -X POST -H \"x-api-key: YOUR_KEY\" https://kusama.api.subscan.io/api/now\n```\n\nAn example of partial response headers:\n\n<div class=\"center-column\"></div>\n\n```\nratelimit-remaining: 7\nratelimit-limit: 10\nratelimit-reset: 22\n```\n\nIf the client reached the rate limit, all other requests in the time slot will be throttled with an HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` response that contains a [`retry-after` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After).\n\nAn example of partial response headers:\n\n<div class=\"center-column\"></div>\n\n```\nretry-after: 4\nratelimit-remaining: 0\nratelimit-limit: 10\nratelimit-reset: 4\n```\n\nAn example of response body:\n\n<div class=\"center-column\"></div>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\":\"API rate limit exceeded\"\n}\n```\n\n<aside class=\"notice\">\nIt is highly recommended to build your client with a backoff strategy to wait for <code>\"retry-after\"</code> seconds when hitting rate limits.\n</aside>\n\n## HTTP Status Codes\n\nThe table down below lists several HTTP status codes that Subscan might respond.\n\n| Code                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 200 OK                    | The request was handled without any error.                                                                                                      |\n| 401 Unauthorized          | The credentials is either not found or invalid.
